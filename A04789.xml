            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F the Church and Houſe of the Lorde God, were or had beene tyed to any one man, for his ſkill and cunning woorkemanship in the ſame: There mighte haue ſtepped foorth, and shewen themſelues greatly greeued (honourable, and my very good Lorde) moſt ſinguler and learned men in this common wealth: That for age through diſcretion: for life through grauitee: for time, in wiſdome: for prayſe and ſpeeche of people, by their rare and goodly giftes: could very wel and in due ſeaſon, haue chalenged the firſt place, and taken vpon them the firſt roome, to haue made diſpatchall, and finished vp this litle building, rather then any other. Whervnto not withſtandyng, I haue now put my hands, with Morter and Lyme and ſuch homely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion, as I haue founde in the Countrie ſince my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from Cambridge. Very bolde now, as at other times I haue been with your Fatherhood, to open my entente and meanyng in this labour of myne. That the care wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto I am bounde by priuate dutie, may from henceforth diſcharge it ſelfe: And that wereſome and great burthen layde on our ſhoulders, that be the diſpenſers of the word of God, the ſooner lightned. I haue not giuen my tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle, and this the ſweate of my browes, to <hi>Ariſto Chius,</hi> (as in Fables) but I haue ſearched and made choyſe in the prae<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſentyng
<pb facs="tcp:8428:3"/>of this my ſmall gifte, of your Honour, then any other: For that by good right, you chalenge the firſt frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of my youthe: Whom it pleaſed in younge dayes, and this my infancie, to ingrafte &amp; plante in, as one thought worthie ſome place, in the vineyarde of the Lorde. And I doubt not, but that rule and gouernement, wherewith God hath bleſſed you in this Common welth of England, shall haue as glorious an ende, in the ſuppreſsing &amp; roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of ſinne, as it hath had a bleſſed entraunce, and continued vntill this day, in ſupporting and mainteining of the truth: If any thing in this my ſmall volume, shall appeare to beleſſe ſtudied, and more craggedly handled, then commonly the ſtoorehouſes of young Occupiers, as I am, ought to be. I haue a good excuſe vnto your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: in that a more toubleſome and perelous time, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer happened, by the ſpace of this one whole yeare, then hath done vnto me: either els leſſe fruit, and ſmaller commoditie gleaned vp by the hands of any one labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer: or greater ſorrowe, or lingering hope: or ſore at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temps, or the like flames, and ſuch contentions (as your Honour verie well knoweth) that I haue thought him much diſquieted, that hath not ſought quietneſſe, in ſo vnquiet a life. And yet in theſe toſſings and tumblings, wherein I am ſweltered in manner, and ouercome, with out any hope of recouery, I may not be altogether diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed: neither will I ſtay the courſe I haue begonne: but faire and ſaftely ſtep by ſtep drayle forwarde, till that time the Lorde God shall releaſe vs: The cauſes hereof with my iudgment of the ſame: pleaſe it you to turne ouer but fewe leafes, they will shewe what manner a ones they be. At the end of this booke, I haue offered to your Lordeship, the copie of that Sermon, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie noates and certeine wordes (almoſt) which I ſpeake, when you thought good, to appoint me at Fulham your Mannor, this yeare laſt paſt of our Lord. 1577. Vppon Aſcention day at the making of miniſters, there to
<pb facs="tcp:8428:3"/>preach before the Cleargie men. This I haue done at the ſute and earneſt requeſt, of certeine my friendes of the Cytie of London (men of good calling, &amp; worship) then at that time preſent, though vnknowen vnto you, when I preached there. Theſe I could not thruſt away in ſo good a demaunde: neither durſt I withſtand them in ſo reigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous a cauſe: Yet I conſithered, that the right therof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed not to them, for it pleaſed you to take it at my handes, at that time by commaundement: Therefore haue I made reſtitution of the ſame. For then they hearde it, then they begged it, when as I ſpeake it: But now I write it, though they requirde it, and as due debt, I reſtore it vnto your honour. Both which: theſe shorte bookes (as you may knowe the ſtudie of young deuines moſt commonly buſied in) I giue them, as a pawne and pledge of that duetie that I owe vnto you: And I deſire of the Lorde God, to increaſe you in all ſpirituall giftes in Ieſus Chriſt, that the whole workmanship and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Lorde, may be fully finished: all rotten, and shackering ſprigges that ouershadowe the Church of God, cut off: all idle, ſluggish, and hollowe harted men, diſcerned: to the increaſe of his name, the ſetting forth of his glorie, the abolishing of Poperie and ſuperſtici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the farthering of tranquilitie and peace, in theſe our borders.</p>

Wherfore I haue aboue all other, as one albeit in the gréenenes of my dayes (peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alſo rawnes of time) far vnméete to diſcerne ſo great a matter. Yet made choyſe eſpecially of this, that a playne and perfect way may be knowen wherin to walke. For that euery one is ready to come vnto the Alter, and many in theſe dayes thinke them ſelues diſcharged, come they to the Temple to heare <hi>Elyas.</hi> And this vayle it is taken away more eaſely, as wee bee readier to ſerue God ſinſearly. But if any man thinke I haue donne him
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8428:10"/>iniury, in decidinge this I appeale to the Booke of God to trye it. In whoſe name, I require all ſuch as feare his Maieſty, and loue the truth, to giue mée liberty to vſe my ſpeeche oue houre or two: Then ſhall hee ſeeme very Chriſtianly bente, when hee examineth all things by the worde of the Lorde, or liueth ſo all the dayes of his life, that prayinge de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutly, hee pray vnfaynedly: or crauinge needely, hee doo it neighbourly: or aſkinge earneſtly it bee done brotherly in all his dealings.</p>
            <p>The occaſion of theſe words of our Sauiour Chriſt, was taken of a queſtion mooued of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, namely how and after what manner it was expedient to pray? And this, it was drawne from the cuſtome and ordinance of the diſciples of <hi>Iohn:</hi> ſo that theſe few lines haue two things in generall therin contayned. Firſt, a demaund or requeſt of his diſciples. Next an aunſwere or replye, to the peticion of his ſayd ſcholers. Both which giue mee occaſion to deuide or make diſtribution of the ſame wordes: for in the demaunde or requeſte of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, is contayned an entraunce or pathway vnto prayer, which you ſhall finde to be onely handled in this firſt péece of this worke, and as for the anſwere of Chriſt, that, it is now too long to ſtand vpon: for a bréefe expoſition with the meaning therof, it is to bée looked for, in the ſeconde part of this Booke. The knowledge how to praye, with the demaunde or queſtion, hath théeſe foure péeces, ſeuerally deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by themſelues.</p>

               <hi>¶ Cauſes that wee haue neede of</hi> Prayer are theſe.</p>
            <p>FIrſt, the expres word of God that commaundeth vs to pray. The queſtion is when? and it muſt be alwayes, as <hi>Mat. 7.7. Luk. 18.1. Rom. 12.12. Eph. 6.18. Coloſ. 4.2. 1. Tim. 2.8. Pro. 18.23. 1. Theſ. 5.17. Pſal. 50.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſeconde cauſe that wée haue néede of prayer is ſhowen in the examples of our forfathers in the Law, and before the Law, accordinge to the will of God that ought to mooue vs: of <hi>Abell. Gen. 4.4.</hi> of <hi>Seth. Gen. 4.26.</hi> of <hi>Noe. Gen. 6.6.</hi> and <hi>Gen. 8.22.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this age menne are not ſayd to haue ſo full knowledge of God, onely to haue ſacrifiſed, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on God, and not by the word praying. Albeit it was not without interceſſion. But in the dayes of <hi>Abram,</hi> afterwarde called <hi>Abraham,</hi> the way and manner of calling on the name of God, is moſt liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed, as <hi>Gen. 22.8. Gen. 13.4.</hi> Therfore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo had <hi>Abraham,</hi> the commendation of the Lord, in the training and bringing vp of his youth and houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde, as <hi>Gen. 18.19.</hi> So <hi>Abraham</hi> his ſeruaunt praied, when hée went to get his Maiſters Sonne a Wife, from <hi>Caran</hi> of <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> of the houſe of <hi>Nicor. Gen. 24.12.</hi> So <hi>Iſaack</hi> went out to pray in the eueninge, <hi>verſe. 63.</hi> After this began the word of God to bée more fully knowne vnto our fathers. Hee was not onely more openly worſhipped, but more reuerently and duely honored. For <hi>Moyſes</hi> prayed forty dayes and forty nightes. <hi>Deut. 9.25.</hi> Alſo for his Siſter Mary, ſtroken with a leoproſie, for that ſhée rebelled agaynſt her Brother. <hi>Numb 12 13.</hi> Therfore alſo God commaunded <hi>Ioſuah,</hi> to meditate in the booke of his Law: day and night.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8428:11"/>
               <hi>Ioſuah. 1.8.</hi> After which time they of Iſraell gaue them ſelues to more earneſt obedyence, and more pure and ſinceare reuerence of his Maieſty: Great men, aunciant Matrons, Kings, and Princes loued him faythfully, called on his name conſtantly, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their homage and obedyence openly. <hi>Hanna</hi> wife vnto <hi>Helcana,</hi> in the ſight of the Preeſt. <hi>2. Sam. 1 Debora</hi> and <hi>Barack. Iud. 5.1. Iudith</hi> in the miſery and calamytie of her Citezens. <hi>13.2.</hi> And <hi>Dauid</hi> ſanctified the name of him that was Almighty, and aſked councell of the Lord God <hi>2. Sam. 5.</hi> by <hi>Abia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar</hi> the highe Préeſte. After that hee daunced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Arke of God. <hi>2. Sam. 6.</hi> Then at the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinge receyued of <hi>Nathan</hi> with the certeinty of his kingedome, with an aunſweare of the houſe hée would haue builte: hée went in, and ſate before the Lorde, and worſhipped. <hi>2. Sam. 7.18:</hi> ſo did <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> euen in the royaltye and ſtatelyneſſe of his Princes. Offering vp burnt offrings, and treſpas offerings and conſecrating the Temple newly dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated. <hi>2. Kings. 8.22.</hi> ſtoode before the Alter in the ſight of the congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſtretched out his hands towardes Heauen. In the ſame manner Chriſte prayed for vs. <hi>Ioh. 16.26.</hi> and <hi>17.9.</hi> and <hi>20.</hi> Hée prayeth alſo for <hi>Peter. Luk. 22.32. Paull</hi> prayeth without ceaſinge. <hi>1. Theſ. 1.2.</hi> Hée prayeth in the Temple. <hi>Act. 22.17.</hi> Hée faſteth and prayeth. <hi>Act. 14.23.</hi> So that Ideines baniſhed, ſlothe aboliſhed, our mindes ſtrengthned: In deſiring readynes, in praying ſteadines, in beléeuing perfectnes, can not, but they muſt thorowly cupple vs and chayne vs to the Lorde, make vs readye by the examples of our Predeceſſors, and of God himſelfe, to obaye and prayſe him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>¶ The thirde cauſe, is,</hi> The neceſſity of man that néedeth all thinges, for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:8428:12"/>what haue wée, that wée haue not from the Lorde. Meate to nouriſh vs: apparrel to clothe vs: the Sun to comfort vs: the Moone to pleaſure vs: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Starres in their brightnes: the Sommer in his gallantnes: the Springtyde in his pleaſantneſſe, all commeth from the Lorde.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>¶ The fourth cauſe is,</hi> The daunger and perrill wherin wée bée, ſo often times fallinge, ſo often ſlyppinge, ſo continually tranſgreſſing the will of the higheſt. At our birthe very vnwillinge to enter into theſe miſeries, yet taſting of the vanities and delights of the fleſh, wée choke vp the good giftes of God, and are daily way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed doune, with greater encomberaunces. If wee looke vp to Heauen, the glory and furniture therof condempneth vs, for they ronne out their race, and kéepe their appoynted circuit, as men of war, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared vnto battayle, they neuer retire backe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crowned. Man only among them that haue reaſon, very vnreaſonable, alwayes rebelleth and reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with God. If wée turne our eyes to ſee the earth, the creatures therin, they curſe the ſtate of man, and grone to bée at liberty, acknowledginge our fall, and ſéeinge the diſhonour wherunto wee be come, that ſtandinge ſo ſurely, wauer now ſo brickelly, and liuing happely, are now faine to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery: decayinge not ſtayinge, till hée that ſit aboue in the Heauens renue agayn our former ſtate, and bringe vs holme to lyfe. Therfore pray without interceſſion, that the god of glory may recompence thoſe that bée his, at his appearing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>¶ The fifth cauſe is,</hi> The deliuerance by the Lord, that other wiſe weare helpleſſe. For as they whoſe bones were wearied in <hi>Aegipt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exo. 5.16.</note> whoſe ſinewes and ioyncts were benom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with making bricke, that could get no ſtubble
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:8428:12"/>and ſtrawe to burne their Clay, that had litle reſt and ſmall quiet, vntill God appoynted his meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſent his ſeruants in ſignes and wonders to reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kew them. So wée, if bleſſednes come not from the ſtrength of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> and quietnes from him that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>Iacob,</hi> and a pleaſant looke from him that erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Hill of <hi>Sion,</hi> and deliuerance from Chriſt, and ſtrength from God: neyther can wée, neyther may wée, neyther ought wée, to hope for any ſafety whatſoeuer. The Lord our God, hee is a man of warre, his name is <hi>Iehouah:</hi> hée ſcattereth the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryots in his wrath, hée ſendeth out lightning in his fury, hee chaſtneth his enemies as a valiaunt cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, and battereth in péeces the bulworkes of the wicked: ſo excelent is hée, and ſo kinde a Lord, vnto ſuch as feare him, that trouble, perſecution, death it ſelfe is conquered, where hée helpeth vs: anguiſh of minde, and penury bée co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon meſſengers, where hée aſſaulteth vs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>¶ The ſixth cauſe is, and the laſt.</hi> The Diuil and Sathanas, that aſſayeth continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and worketh craftely, to bereaue vs of the honor wée looke for, from the Lorde. That ſubtilly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenteth vs, watchfuly intangleth vs: ſo deceiptful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſnareth vs, to driue vs from our God. Hée hath a number at his becke, as Pages to wayte on vs. Seruaunts hée hath great ſtore at his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to withdrawe vs: eſpyes hee appoynteth to ranſacke our dooinges, the more eaſely to betray vs. For hée is the prince of this world, hee ruleth chéef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye. <hi>Eph. 2.2. Ioh. 12.31.</hi> Many wayes hée may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerreatch vs, for diuerſe hée his pretences, pleaſant hée his fetches to intrap vs, when reaſon is exiled, and ſhée hath loſt her ſeate: when Wiſdome is ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, &amp; content to ſéeke out an other corners to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor in: when the pleaſauntnes of the brayne, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:8428:13"/>finenes of thy wit is fled awaye. When thy younge dayes are gon, and the gréeneneſſe of thy youth wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered vp. When wantonnes hath ruſhed out, and thou thy ſelfe wareſt dimme: when ſtrength faileth thée, and thy ſtout and courragious men are fayne to bough, and the Elements can féed thee no longer, and thou layd in thy Pauilion, &amp; thy Tente pitched in the ground, thy body layed vnto the earth, and thy ſpirite in his powre that gaue it thée: ſhall hee not giue a ſhrewde aſſault and lay vnto thy charge, and vpbrayde thée with thy miſdeeds, that hath ſo long a time accuſed our bretheren day and night before the Lorde? <hi>Reu. 12.10.</hi> If hée ſpared not <hi>Iehoſuah</hi> the heighe Préeſte,
<note place="margin">Zach. 3.2.</note> ſtandinge before the Aungell of the Lord. But ſuffered rebuke at the hands of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and as yet ceaſeth not to vere his ſainctes. The onely way that wée haue to auoyde him, is by our interceſſion and prayer to the Lord, offered vp in golden veſſels before our God, to make an Atton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for our ſinnes: and heare is ſumwhat to bee conſithered alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For there is two kindes of prayer one of good men, of euil me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Full deare in the ſight of the Lord, is the prayers of his ſaincts, and his eares are open vnto their cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge, who is there that hath failed that put his truſt in the Lorde? or hath hée deſpiſed the ſighinge of a contrite harte. Then to put a difference in this world of thoſe that bée Gods, and of ſutch as bee not. Certayne there bee, whoſe mone and gronings the Lord God regardeth, other there bée whom hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temneth. <hi>Abraham</hi> when <hi>Lot</hi> his brother, was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the fiue Kinges,
<note place="margin">Gen. 14.16</note> perſued the Chaſe, armed his younge men, went downe to battayle, was hard of God, and wonne the feelde. But <hi>Ahab,</hi> though
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:8428:13"/>
               <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> were with him, and helped him,
<note place="margin">2. Kings. 22.35.</note> though his peticion was for victory, yet hee had the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe. His Prophets begiled, and <hi>Micheah</hi> his prayer hard, and hée ſaued: a difference there was, betwixte <hi>Abell</hi> his offeringes, and the offeringe of <hi>Cayen.</hi> And God appeared vnto <hi>Laban</hi> in Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to warne him, when hée haſted after <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> his wife and his ſeruaunts. But to <hi>Iacob</hi> in <hi>Bethell,</hi> when hee lay a ſleepe and leaned on the Stone, in great excellencie and maieſtie, appeared hée to comforte him. <hi>Dauid</hi> his prayer for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when hée numbred them: was contrary to <hi>Saul</hi> his peticion of the Lorde, when hée went to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntreſſe to ayde him. And as <hi>Huſay</hi> his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell the <hi>Arachite,</hi> was more precious to his Lord, then was that of <hi>Ahitophell:</hi> ſo bee the prayers of Saincts, then of <hi>Hipocrits:</hi> and of the good, then of wicked, and of the poore in hart, then of diſſemblers. Al giue not eare to <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſome die with <hi>Scorpions.</hi> The <hi>Manhu</hi> it nouriſhed not alike, for to ſome it is deſtruction in the eatinge: there is one <hi>Ieſabell</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge the Princes: one <hi>Nabal</hi> among the <hi>Iſraelits:</hi> one <hi>Iſmael</hi> in <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe: one <hi>Abſolon</hi> in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi> Courte: ſo is there many <hi>Hipocrits</hi> among me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Some euill cluſters among Grapes: ſome Briers amonge trées: ſome Nettels among hearbes: ſome Darnell among corne: ſome Cockle among wheat: and ſome wicked among good. The Sea it hath the Saphirre, and the Diamonde, and the Emeroide, and it hath the Pupill Stones, and it hath the ſtately Fiſhe, and the thinne and tender Barcks, as well as great and mighty ſhippes. The earth it ſelfe hath many children, and from her breſts come diuers Twinnes, yet bée they not alike. The woods they haue their Pine, their Peatche, their Elme, their Apple, their Ciprus, and their Cedrus, the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:8428:14"/>Violet, and the Criſtolet, it hath the Brome, it hath the Nut, it hath the Crab: and ſo hath God, hée hath the good, hée hath the bad. The Heauens they make but one compaſſe, they draw their traine alike, and very gloriouſly they incloſe with like countenance all ſuch as dwell on earth: Yet tell mee which of them treadeth like ſteppes as other doo? or runneth not ſwiftly, or flyeth ſpeedely, or bendeth crookedly, or windeth narrowly, or praunſeth not forth more valiauntly, or ells retireth wearely, or mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth not forth more gréedely? Againe to wée not wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der at the Sonne, that leadeth the forefronte of the battayle, with his glittering armour? whom the moone folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth with contrary attire, the Ringeleader and Miſtreſſe of the night: vpon whom there wayteth ſuch a number of fayre damſels, euery one hauinge ſo ſeueral a countenaunce, that ech man may know their diſpoſitions, their way vnto their houſes is ſo contrary. Then let man alone, for hée hath diuers children: and let him that is aboue worke in man, for ſundry bée his benefittes, and let vs ſubmit our ſelues vnto the hands of God that guideth vs. For as out of the <hi>Eden</hi> goeth a Kiuer that watereth the Garden, and is deuided into foure heads. And as <hi>Phishon</hi> compaſſeth the land of <hi>Hauilah</hi> where ther is good Golde, where the <hi>Bdelium</hi> and the <hi>Onix</hi> Stone is: the other ſpringes doo run to other Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes, wherin wée can not finde ſo pretious Iewele: euen ſo is man deuided by the Lorde: ſome borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring as it were at the mouth of <hi>Eden,</hi> ſauer of more fine, and better mettall, then they of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> doo. Others bée content with baſe and homly Golde: the third kinde it ſauoreth of that which is more groſſe and brickle then the reſt. The fourth is ſo far from heate, that very litle which is good is found there. And ſo fareth it with man, ſomtimes the worde is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:8428:14"/>choked vp, it is ſcattered among thornes: often times it taketh roote, but it is blaſted ſodenly, the Sun ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth it, it ſeldome bringeth forth fruit, ſo hard and ſtony is the hart of man that receiueth it. Therfore the <hi>Phareſay</hi> hee prayed,

<note place="margin">Math. 6.</note> and in the corners of ſtreetes, to bee ſeene of men, thy prayers are longe, thy talke is much, and thy tongue it ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth many howres in vanities, repeatinge diuers praiers as the heathen doo, but thou haſt thy reward, for the Lord loueth the puritie of the ſoule, &amp; the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gryte of the harte is burnt ſacrifiſe, ſo that at length wee may ſhut vp this péece and returne to ſome other for ſeeing that good and bad are among men, and for that all thinke they pray aright when they go wrong, I haue ſought out an other waye: euen for him that wilbe godly, to bee godly ſtill, and haue appoynted out a more perfect and orderly manner then this is wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in euery one that is good, wilbe buſied. Now then hauing ſumthing roughly handled this my firſt péece of this worke, I crane of you to heare the reſt. For that which foloweth is groſſer a great deale, and not ſo fine as that euen now came out of Eden, and this our cuntry it hath not ſo well bin tilled of late, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue men ſo regarded their welth, as there they doo: but ſuch as it is I giue it you, and a better care, may happely aforde ſome better fruite, and now wee proceede to the ſeconde parte: namely to ſearch out what prayer is.
<note place="margin">What prayer is thought to be among the learned.</note>
            </p>
            <p>As of a Letter by wrighting to a freind, ſuch is the force of prayer in ſpeaking to God, wherof I may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine

That ſame <hi>Ephraem</hi> hath yet gonne farther in this, hée ſearcheth out more narrowly, the dealinges of the world and preuenteth that ſame glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious pompe in our profeſſors, that lay open their thoughts, and ripp vp their cogitacions to bée ſéen of men. with which kynde of people I profeſſe my ſelfe mutch to haue delt withall, and glad I am it pleaſed God to let mée haue ſight of ſutch in theſe my younge dayes, for that I may beeware the better in ryper yéeres. But his councell it is not to praye for our ſelues but for all, euen ſutch as bée Chriſtians and of the Lorde: and not for our fréends but euen for thoſe that hate vs. I thinke hée hath ſufficiently glaunced at our Anabaptiſts, that beſide their error in miſly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our manner of prayer (holdinge with none but ſutch as is framed and ordered by them) intertayne but litle order in the Church, but careles in life, and ſuſpected in their dealing, make the Goſpell a coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and the word a cloake to diſſemble with: regard ſutch as fauor them: preſume to appoincte the elect of the Lord at their ſeuerall iudgments: pray for ſutch as bée of their Church: kéepe ſecret the dealinges of vngodly men: (leaſt their profeſſion and calling bee diſhoneſted) as though <hi>Dauid</hi> could not offend, or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> tranſgreſſe the will of God, (bee it reuerently ſpoken and with feare) but the Churche of God ſhould ſuffer Shipwracke for it.

And this ſore, it is ſo feſtred &amp; writhed already into the harts of men, that an Iron to ſeare it is better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a plaiſter to mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefy it with. And if God doo not giue an other ſpirit, or dalyaunce bée deferred as yet it is: I haue at this tyme but looked at them, if God permit, and leyſure ſerue, and theſe outragious enemyties ſtil continue, I am not purpoſed to leaue them ſo rawly. But ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlipping my ſelf I haue plunged vnaduiſedly to come

And yet not ſo, nor ſo wiſely neyther if wee conſider all. For it is wiſdome to cut of him in thy owne Campe firſt, if ſo thy liberty permitteth thee: and then to wreſtle with the forraner: but content I am, and I ſtriue not nowe: I will arme my ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt ſome other time. Only let them take heede they come not nearer, for if they doo, though now they bée without reatch: yet Pen, Inke, and Paper, ſhall neuer ſpare them: wel to leaue this of our diſordered and crooked dealing, let vs approtche to that which is more pleaſaunt, and frutefull, then is this: and if thou wilt pray, and pray aright, pray thus.</p>
            <p>Firſt in ſpirite <hi>Ephe. 6.8. Iude. 20.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Our order and manner in praying.</note> and in many other places: the reaſon hereof is. For that the man alwayes occupyed in his traficke, is not able to vſe the body, the ioynctes, the lymmes, the outward geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as other doth, whoſe leyſure ſuffereth them to praye at all times: but euen this is required in him, as in all other, to lifte vp himſelf, to erecte and reare him vp, in ſoule, in ſpirit in hart vnto the Lord: that the affayres and dealings in this world ouercome thée not.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in fayth. <hi>Math. 2.12, Mark. 11.23. Ioh. 15.7. Iam. 1.6.</hi> and the <hi>5.15. Ephe. 3.12. Ephe. 2.8.</hi> and els wheare. For as God hath left vnto vs, all manner of inſtrumentes to woorke by, as hee hath giuen vs a meane and way on earth, to labour by, as man hath his ſeuerall manner to inritch him with: So for the ſpirituall affayres, for thy woorke, for thy waye, for thy labour, for thy cuſtome to attaine thy honor with all, is theare of vs all, as common vnto all, one onely inſtrument which is ſayth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly it muſt bée donne, in the name of Chriſt
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:8428:18"/>alone, wher in is ſecluded all manner worſhip and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation eyther of Saincts, eyther of men, eyther of creature on the earth.

But théeſe bee the cauſes for which wée are charged and inioyned to thinke that wée haue ſaluation in the name of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>¶ The firſt cauſe for which wee pray, in the name of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For that hée onely forgiueth ſinnes. <hi>Math. 9.2. Actes. 10.43. Rom. 8.4. 1. Cor. 5.18. Ephe. 1.7.</hi> and the fourth, the thirtéenth verſe: otherwiſe wée might pray to the Blocke and to the ſtone, and to the thinge that créepeth, and profiteth vs not. For what aduauntage had wée in ſorrowing all the dayes of our life, and in the ende when the wrinckels in our ſace appeareth, and the meſſenger doth his duty and citeth vs before the Lorde, then wee bée ſtill in death, and life is kepte from vs? then this is the ende bereof. Namely that our tranſgreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s may be hid, and our ſinnes couered, and that wée may haue remiſſion of the ſame, and life eternall; which is the firſt cauſe we pray in the name of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, for that hee is the way, the truth, and the life: <hi>Ioh. 14.5.</hi> and <hi>26. Ioh. 11.2. Ioh. 14 6. Actes. 3.15.1. Ioh. 1.2.1. Ioh. 5.11.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:8428:18"/>illutions. For if wee ſéeke for lyſe? wee haue it in Chriſte, that dyed for vs to bringe vs, out of death. If for a guide? wee haue the ſpirit that will conducte vs in the right way, and leade vs to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: if the truth? there was no blemiſh found on his lippes, nor deceypt in his tongue, and hée brought in the truth the Goſpell of his Father, and the woord of lyfe, kept ſecret from the beginning of the world, and reuealed in theſe latter daies vnto the ſonnes of men wherfore wee néede to ſéeke no farther, wée haue all things wrought in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The thirde, for that hée is the accompliſhment and ende of the law.

For the lifting vp of thy hands, thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence downward to the ground, thy howlinge and ſhreaking in the Temple, thy knockinge and below<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge at the Alter, thy bent knées, they bee ſome times tokens of Ipocreſy as chriſtianitée. But I ſay, if place and time (though neuer out of time to praye) can bee donne without gazing on of men, and truely and duly. with no affected prayſe of worldlings. I doo appoynt thee all times.

Cor. 2.</hi> That there is now no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Iew and the Gentill, the Barbarian and the <hi>Graetian,</hi> becauſe God is father to them all. And now in Chriſt is that of <hi>Malachy</hi> brought to paſſe, that not in <hi>Iudea</hi> only, but in all the world ſacrifiſe and burnt offerings ſhalbe offered vp vnto the Lorde. And that of Chriſte to the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> accordeth with this.
<note place="margin">Ioh. 4.</note> Arte thou greater then our Father <hi>Iacob</hi> that gaue vs this Well, and hee himſelf dranke therof and his Cattell? and agayne: our Fathers worſhipped in this Mountayne but they ſaye <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> is the place where men doo worſhippe. But ſhee was anſwered by Chriſt. Beléeue mée Woman the howre commeth and now is, when you ſhal neither in this Mountain, nor at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> worſhip the Father: a reaſon is alſo ſurrendered. That the howre ſhalbée and now is, when the true worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in ſpirite and truth: and albeit in the Pſalmes wee finde the affection of the Prophet to haue bin powred out in greater zeale for the Lorde of Hoſtes ſake, as <hi>Pſalm. 67.</hi> Prayſe you the Lord all you nations, and that in the <hi>.117.</hi> I will ſpread abroad and knowledge thy name among the Gentils. Yet is there time and place and occaſion too, to vtter forth our cogitacions, that wee bee not iudged of men. I acknowledge and not vnwillingly, that <hi>Dauid</hi> was in the Caue ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times praying, and in the feelde, and in the Dennes, and in the night, and in his bed: <hi>Ionas</hi> could praye in the belly of the Whale. <hi>Daniell</hi> in the Lions Denne, and his companions lifted vp their voyces in the fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Furnace, and Noe comming out of the Arke in the open ayre.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:8428:21"/>at the ſhoare ſide among the Shippes. And <hi>Paull</hi> with the Elders in the ſight of the people. Yet this is my watchworde, let no man goe beyond his ſkill, nor draw priuate examples to generall obſeruations. But if death and perſecution incroche vpon thée, pray euery where, for thou it is that ſhal glorify the Lord. But if quietnes and reſt bee giuen vnto thee, vſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion and modeſty, in ordering thy forme of prayer.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond thing in this poynt, which I noted in <hi>Paull,</hi> without ceaſing. This is my iudgement: that thou bée like minded in all thinges: and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it is the Lorde, that ſearcheth the harte, and the reynes, that hee will bée worſhipped in Spirite and truth.</p>

For I know there is none whom God hath touched by his ſpirite inwardly, but wiſheth him ſelfe, accurſed to bringe ſaluation vnto all. I ſpeake it, for that it is ſo hard a thing for the ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> to bee agréeable to this in all poynctes: namely one to praye for an other, <hi>Ieam. 5.16.</hi> and for thy enemyes and perſecutors. <hi>Math. 5.44.

But it is not my minde, to vnlaſe and ripp vp the woundes of any man. For euen the vew and ſight of this ſtory, may bée pitiful enough to any Chriſtian. To bringe in place the ſpeakers hereof, It were that of <hi>Atreus</hi> in <hi>Seneca,</hi> and of <hi>Aſtiages</hi> in <hi>Iuſtin</hi> to bid the Father to the cating of his owne Sonne.

               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:8428:24"/>and <hi>6.12.</hi> and. <hi>22.32.</hi> This prayinge, it is of euery one that is of the ſheepfolde of Chriſte, beeing the firſt and cheefeſt poyncte in a Chriſtian, to accuſtome him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnto prayer, of which I haue ſufficiently ſpoken beefore, in the firſt cauſe, that ought to mooue vs to pray: wheras the examples of the Sainctes of God, of the Prophets, of the Patriarkes of Chriſte, of his Apoſtles that vſed alway to praye, may the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlame vs. There ſhalbe therfore no iteration of that now,
<note place="margin">The antiqui tie of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon prayer.</note> let vs onely couſider what it is that is publique, and what therein to bée required.

<note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> For I doubt not but the poore offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe of <hi>Caien</hi> and of <hi>Abell,</hi> was a thinge generallye vſed of the Church in that time, and donne of them as taken from the vſe of the Congregation or meetinge, then vſed:

Not that God had no worſhip, or that there were none that ſerued and called on his name: but then the Church which was before darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned I take it to haue bin agayne newly reſtored.

For it ſeemeth not to mee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, that the benefite which is given vnto euery countrie for their cuſtome, ſhould be reſtrayned and kept backe, becauſe of the mindes of diuers men that be therein.

<note place="margin">Our puplike prayer, is to be referred in eſpetiall to the Sabboth.</note> And this it is which is ſayde to bee the ſeuenth daye, that God bleſſed when hee finiſhed his worke, and the Tabernacle of the Heauens where he ſitteth: The kéeping whereof wilbe better conſidered when the cauſes of the inſtitution thereof bée opened. The firſt cauſe, for which the Sabboth was ordayned, was Economicall or politicke, &amp; it is expedient for the preſeruation and ſafety of man, that hee may reſt his weary bones and eate the labour of his hands, and the ſweate of his browes with ioyfulnes.

               <hi>Athanaſius</hi> is witneſſe hereof in his fourtéenth queſtion. Out of whome I finde a commendation left vnto the churches of <hi>Africa,</hi> that ſo eaſily conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together, making no religion, or putting no ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition in this ſo indifferent a thing.
<note place="margin">Praeciſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, they be vn manerly novv.</note> Alſo in his booke <hi>de Spiritu ſancto, Baſill</hi> hath left this as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie memorie, that on the Sonday, they were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to pray ſtanding, becauſe as that day Chriſte roſe from death. And they noted this in them ſelues, to be ſuch as ſhould be erected in ſoule vnto the Lord. And as they did ſtande on the earth, ſo they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed to looke vpwarde to heauen for grace. The twentieth Canon of the counſell of <hi>Nece,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Concilium Nicenum.</note> as it is rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned by <hi>Gratian,</hi> reporteth this ſame thing to bée done of them all on the Sabboth. And at Pentecoſt, where (as I take it) partly from <hi>Baſill</hi> and <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> and from the cuſtome of the Primatiue Church. All our churches at this day, our chappels, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſtande Eaſtwarde. But let it paſſe: Our time it néede not to take ſo heauily theſe the rytes and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances which wee haue: for as they be not many, ſo if wée were peſtered as the Primatiue church was (which God forbid) yet howe vntowardly woulde it be taken? And nowe to cut of this third parte alſo,
<note place="margin">Much ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, ſmall Chriſtianitie in a number of theſe.</note> for our manner of prayer: thus I think, that the beſt and the fartheſt from ſuperſtition, and the néereſt to Chriſte, and the moſte excellent, to ſet out our reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and duetie, is at our comming together, to pray knéeling.</p>
            <p>Thus at the length wée are arriued at our laſte
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:8428:30"/>holde, and compelled for want of winde and weather in ſo perilous ſailing, to caſt Anchor. But howe ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it be, we hoyſted out, becauſe it is with ſome daunger, contented we are to beare the burthen, &amp; to require others to take ſome pitie of vs to: for I knowe that this is not taken in hande without the looking on of many Sea men, that would right glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet ſaile to their greater veſſels, that harder paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage might be permitted to our ſmall barke. For this cauſe alſo I take the Sunne and the Skye as I finde it, and content to enioy the ſmall libertie that is lefte. And greater ſpeede is made to bring vs home, for that if ſo we chaunce to periſhe by the way &amp; ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſhipwracke, other men may take héede by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerthrowe of this our Boate, more warely in their iourney to looke to theirs. For outleaping all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences hetherto, that be comon in the world, we are like to be grounded on two as perilous rocks, as the hearte and imagination of man can wiſhe vs to. Before, we had to do with them, that for their vnſkilfulneſſe in the vſe of prayer,
<note place="margin">Hovve to prepare our ſelues to praye, the laſt parte of this booke.</note> were happely to be pardoned. And nowe commeth in howe it is wée ſhould prepare our ſelues to prayer. The fourth &amp; laſt thing that I noted in the queſtion that was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: This it may ſeeme to be verie common, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining onely to men of greate diſcretion:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For nowe we haue to deale with proude and hawtie ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maches that can debaſe others, to raiſe and lifte vp them ſelues:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> We muſt encounter with the Hype<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, with whome there will be harde wreſtling, he will diſſemble ſo gloriouſly.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> There muſt alſo a view and ſight be taken of the faithleſſe man, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth halting before the Lord, and is not ſo mutche as the guide and maiſter of his owne minde.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The double dealer hath his portion in this place, for his prayers and his manners agréeing not, hee neuer
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:8428:30"/>getteth any thing of the Lorde. Alſo, for that euery man commeth at appointed ſeaſon,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> to aſke of God his peticion, it muſt not be vnſeemely for his maic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie. Laſt of all,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> there muſt be perſeuerance &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in our prayer: for the running &amp; the gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die hedded man, he is an extrauigant vnto the Lord. So that all things duely wayed, we haue yet ſmall cauſe to bragge, that may eaſily be caſt off in ſo peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous a gulfe. Howeuer that it be, if God permit, we will go forward: and becauſe the iudgements of men be frée, and the way ſo open, I doubt not but to finde ſome one or other in the way to ſuccour vs. The order that I tooke in hande,
<note place="margin">The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> thing in our preparacion to prayer, it to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and lovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in heart.</note> I was loth to break it, therefore in the queſtion, who it is that prayeth? it is aunſwered, the holie and humble ſpirited man, that commeth drenched all in teares, and that would touche the hemme of Chriſtes garment, rather than be will departe vnhealed. This humblenes of mind it is of two ſortes: for there is one that is among men. <hi>Math 18.4.</hi> and <hi>23.12. Luke. 14.11. Rom. 12.16. Ephe. 4.2. Phil. 2.3. colloſ. 3.12. 2.

And theſe men that can créepe on the earthe for aduantage, and kiſſe thy féete to ingroſſe commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, and can hoorde vp ſubſtance in their cofers, that looke ſo ſtily,
<note place="margin">The manner of vvorling<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:8428:31"/>iniurie as ſpitefully, &amp; backbite as malitiouſly, as he that ſéeketh to get the greateſt game, and ſtriueſt moſte: ſuch a one is not méete to come before the Lorde and his annointed, nor to aſke at the hands of God. If he do, I ſay vnto him, he hath his reward. There is another kinde of humilitie, and it is onely in debaſing our ſelues, whereby we become as litle children without pride and hawtineſſe of minde, fit to be receiued vnto the Lorde. Of this humilitie wee read <hi>Math. 18 10. Luke. 18.14. Iames. 4.10.</hi> For all ſhewe of righteouſneſſe, all manner of vprightneſſe in thy ſelfe muſt be ſecluded, &amp; the grace of the Lorde is that which is ſufficient for vs. If any ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume by way of ſute to arrogate any thing vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that is due vnto the Prince: the ſtate of that man is verie daungerous. But if thou lay not thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities abrode, and vncouer not thy nakednes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord God, when thou entereſt into his ſeate and iudgeſt preſumptuouſly in thine owne eyes,
<note place="margin">Humilitie in all at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer.</note> then looke about and beware. For of a trueth, he hath the lawe, and the Scepter, and he hath the ſworde to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy thée. Remember <hi>Dauid</hi> his ſupplication vnto the Lord.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 25.</note> O thinke vpon thy tender mercie, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing kindneſſe, for they haue béene for euer. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not the ſinnes of my youth, nor my rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but according to thy kindneſſe remember thou mée for thy goodnes ſake O Lorde. I thinke <hi>Dauid</hi> indifferently ſmyteth vs vnto the quicke: and he that ſhall turne him ſelfe to ſée the manners of our time, will thinke there is ſcarce a God vppon the earth, to ſée what glorie he ſuffereth in the vngodly men, and to ſée howe the head of the iuſt is couered with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches. But as the beautie of the Sunne, till the cloude ouerſhadowe it, and as is the Palme trée, till the froſt nippeth it, &amp; as the bloſſome of the Peache, till the winde alter it: ſo is the beautie of the wicked
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:8428:31"/>til y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumeth him. For if God enter into iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what fleſh ſhall bee iuſtefied in his ſight?
<note place="margin">Dan. 9.</note> For euen this confeſſed <hi>Daniel</hi> in that hee and other of the Church preſented not their ſupplications before God, for their owne rightuouſnes: but for his owne mercy ſake, foreſeeing that wee of <hi>Adam,</hi> are by nature the Children of death, to what ende ſhall wee ſtriue with God, whoſe ſpirite hath not alwayes ſtriued with vs? For he knew that wee were but fleſh,
<note place="margin">Gen. 8.</note> and that vayne were the cogitacions and thoughtes of man from his youth. Then let this bee our firſt way to prepare our ſelues to goe to prayer: that wee take vnto vs humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, and debaſe our ſelues before the Lorde.
<note place="margin">The ſtate of ſuch as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond kinde of ſeruice or duety wee owe, and rightly to come vnto prayer is this: that wee bee not gilty of that in <hi>Eſay.</hi> This people confeſſeth mee with their lippes but their hartes are far from mee: Hee that is offender herein, is not fitte to come vnto the Lorde, namely to haue thy body at the Temple, and thy preſence at the Alter, and thy harte at holme. Can the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> be made white? or the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer chaunge his courſe? Can you gather Grapes of Thiſtles, and Figges of Thornes? wilt thou fetch Honye out of the Rocke? and the Sunne beames from the duſkiſhnes of the night? or the <hi>Criſtolet?</hi> or the <hi>Saphir,</hi> out of all quarters of the earth? No more will hée his glorye from the wicked, nor his loue and fauour from the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, nor ioy and Heauen from the diſſembler, nor his Chriſt and his owne preſence will hee ſhew for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnto the Hypocrite. I remember I ſpake hereof before, yet it is neceſſary to touch it now: that the iuſt meaſure of the man of God may appeare.</p>
            <p>The third thinge, or the preparation and pathway that wée may haue more aſſured entrance into praier,
<note place="margin">The perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the man of God.</note> is to bée of a faythfull and vpright conuerſation, and to bée ſteady in fayth. If wee come vnto a Senate or
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:8428:32"/>before graue and auncient councellors, wee repoſe ſome aſſuraunce of that wee come for, in their hands, and I knowe if it bée the price of Monye, there is no man but ſpeketh very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly: Then, if we haue any thing to craue for of the Lord, it behooueth vs to tread our ſteps aright, to lay the forme of our wordes due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, and the manner of our ſpeeche that wée liſpe not, and thy thoughtes and cogitacions, that thou wauer not before his Maieſty: For if thy minde be not ſetled, and thy dealings diſpiſed, and thou thy ſelfe ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that thou ſhiuer not: it is in hazard, but that thy whole requeſt periſheth:
<note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> And to ſay the truth, how can wee call on him on whom wée beleeue not? Goe wée vnto the Mariner and the Seafaring man, and to no ende? or thinke wée then to bée drowned? Doo wée run vnto the Phiſition or wayte wée for poyſon? will the Lawier take his fee for nothinge, or can wée bow our ſelues before our God, as if wee were at <hi>Beershe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi> or at <hi>Dan,</hi> or at the Idolles of <hi>Samaria,</hi> to retourne agayne without aunſwer? then vnhappy truely were our caſe, but euen for this doo we come before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord, to wipe away the teares from our eyes, and the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then from our ſhoulders, and that hee would accepte our fayth. For hee that beléeueth in him hee ſhall not periſhe but haue life: And vnto this ende are we cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that we might bee heires of eternall ſaluation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordinge to hope. <hi>Titus. 3.</hi> Therfore <hi>Ieames:</hi> hee that prayeth let him pray in fayth, not doubtinge, for hee that wauereth is like vnto the leapinges of the Sea, that is turned and walowed in the winde, and let not that man thinke that he ſhall haue any thing from the Lorde,
<note place="margin">Luke 7.</note> that aſketh not ſtedfaſtly. It was well ſayde of the Apoſtle: Lorde increaſe our ſayth, and agayne helpe or vnbeleefe for it is very hard for fleſh and blood to aſke ſo faythfully:

For the ſpirite of God which worketh to the beſt, in thoſe that be his, hath giuen an aſſuraunce to the childryn of obedience: of the life, and of the hidden treaſuries that bee laide vp for the righteous, vntill the daye of reuealing: and for that cauſe to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage vs in the voyage that we haue to goe, God hath confirmed our weakeneſſe with certeine promiſes, that we may in all our dealings ſtande the better. Yet till he bring the ſame to paſſe, he hath layde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs that whiche is requiſite to be done of our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.
<note place="margin">Without grace, vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and vvorking of the Lorde, vvee fall to the ground.</note> This, when by his grace it is finiſhed, hee will make a conſummation and perfection of his bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and wée ſhall obtaine that which we prayed for by faith in Chriſte. Our duetie is firſte of all to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that the faith whiche wee haue (for I knowe that there is none, but they wilbe accounted as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) conſiſteth chiefly of theſe thrée things. Firſt, that there is but one fayth. Secondly, that it is the gifte of God. Thirdly, that it commeth by hearing. For that man that wilbe iuſtified, muſt bee iuſtified through theſe.
<note place="margin">Our faith hath adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the knovvlege therof, three things.</note> That there is but one faith, <hi>Paull</hi> verie notably hath deſcribed to vs in the fourth to the <hi>Epheſians.</hi> There is one Lorde, one faith, one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, one God and father of all, which is aboue all, and through all, and in you al. And as on earth there is one onely ayre that foſtereth vs: ſo is there onely one faith in Chriſt that ſaueth vs.</p>
            <p>The ſeconde thing is: that this faith is the gifte of God. <hi>Math. 11.27. Luke. 17.22. Iohn. 6 44. Act. 15.8.</hi> The reaſon hereof is this: Wee are by nature the children of death, wherein then can we be ſaued but in Chriſt? and Chriſt, he hath giuen vs a meane, &amp; it is faith: and faith bringeth life, ſo that if wee had faith by nature, wée were the children of God and of life by nature. But this is otherwiſe: for as by one man came in death: ſo by one man came in life.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:8428:42"/>And as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was made a liuing ſoule: ſo is the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> made a quickening Spirite: that where as before, we were made children of wrathe and death. Nowe wée are in Chriſte created a new, and faſhioned another lumpe, and made comlyer and better, then before we were. Alſo the wall is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken downe betwixt him and vs, and wée haue frée paſſage to him by faith: and this faith it is giuen vs, for it is the gifte of God.</p>
            <p>The thirde propertie required in this our faith:
<note place="margin">A good to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of a true Iſraelite, to be a hearer of the vvorde: and is alſo verie often a couering for the vvicked, to cloak him vvithall.</note> was that it ſhould come by hearing, <hi>Rom. 10.17.</hi> The occaſion hereof I take to be, that a difference might appeare of the rightuous, &amp; of the vnrighteous man. For, as euery one is readieſt in hearing, ſo ſhoulde he be perfecteſt in his liuing. Yet, this is not as the light in the Sunne, that can not be altered: for our worldlings in theſe dayes are at Sermons with the firſt, but in life the filthieſt. The proofe thereof, it will ſhewe it ſelf, if it were lawfull to touche the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour of priuate men, which offence as I thinke it not expedient to bee giuen in the churche: ſo if it were euer lawfull, I ſuppoſe it to be nowe:
<note place="margin">Papiſtes, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners abroade: and greate ſeekers after Bulles, and pardons: no follovvers &amp; ſeekers of the vvorde of God,</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a number be redier to flye to <hi>Layis</hi> with them of the tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> to be a father and Prieſte to Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: then quietly to ſtaye at home, or do any good in <hi>Siloe.</hi> Their earerings and their iewels, they are too baſe to ſerue their <hi>Mahomet</hi> in their chambers, and to garniſh vp their altars: but zeale that they haue to the houſe of God and his worde: The graine of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarde ſeede ſpoken of in Matthew, and leſſe (if leſſe there may bee) will preſſe it downe with heaped vp meaſure.</p>

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:8428:52"/>that God hath debaſed him ſelfe for vs, and tempered his talke, and applyed his ſpeech vnto our capacities, and hee hath taught vs very breefely to call vpon him: The reaſon hereof is, for that wee are weake and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry feeble in our dooings, in our life,

               <p>That late and worthy man of God <hi>M.

               <p>But to take away this olde wiues Tale, I thinke it expedient to ſay ſomewhat: and at the firſt, rather then to interrupte my ſpeech hereafter: As therfore <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> the Sonnes of <hi>Aaron,</hi> that offered vp incenſe in the ſame Cenſor that their Father did: Yet becauſe they did it not aright they dyed for it. So heare: though wee praye all with one prayer, and powre out our ſupplications at one time, becauſe wée praye not all alike, with minde in ſpirite vnto the Lorde, they bee to none effecte, neyther auayle they: And as there was in the Wilderneſſe one <hi>Manhu,</hi> wheron <hi>Iſraell</hi> fed, yet ſome wicked and diſobedient, had not the like nouriſhment and effect therof as had others: So the prayer of the Lorde, though hée gaue it to all,

So it is with vs. The prayer of the Lorde vnto the wicked, beeing wreſted to their death: as <hi>Samuell</hi> was by the Diuell to blinde <hi>Saull:</hi> ſhall neuer helpe them: But abandon theſe wicked men wee muſt,

There is then many things to be wayed before wee preſume to ground any Religion and health vppon man, for repeating this prayer.

               <p>Trueth it is in <hi>Criſoſtome</hi> his Homily, that <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imus</hi> ſpeaketh. Euery one when he prayeth: let him pray vnto the Lorde: Wherefore my procéeding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this ſo great a matter, maketh mée in doubt, but that the Lorde is, where he alwayes was, to take in hande ſo great a myſterie.

<note place="margin">All ſtates can reaſon, vvhy they need no praier: but all muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them ſelues, and pray to God.</note> Hee that is poore, why ſhoulde I praye (ſaith he) for I haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.

               <p>The proude man, he is in his ruffe, hee noddeth
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:8428:54"/>with his head, and beckeneth with the hande: hee ſetteth ſaile to all things. The inceſtious perſon, what can he aſke? he liueth in pleaſure. The mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunt, what hath he to do with God? the winde and weather ſerueth him.

Then my firſte note is, that this prayer in generall appertaineth to all. For, from the tabernacle to the tente: from him that ſitteth in the gate,

                  <note place="margin">As vvater con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fumeth all: ſo God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troyeth all degrees, if they call not vpon him.</note> nay, though he tarrie at home, and abideth the Sunne all the dayes of his life, and ſuffereth the bitter froſtes in Winter, though hee be created to tende cattell, and to kéepe the wilde Coalte, and the Aſſe in the Wilderneſſe: though his handes be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with the plough, and his arme withered vp with holding of the rake: though he ſit at the threſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde, and haue not wherewithall to féede him: yet hath he his ſoule to looke vnto: that in my iudgement it is time to ſéeke narrowly abroade, to recken with our ſelues, to giue attendaunce, to waite on God:

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:8428:79"/>or what our will is in common affaires, eating and drinking, in cloth, in apparell, in ſuche of that ſorte. Theſe pertaine to the earth: Wée diſpute of that that leadeth vs to heauen.

<note place="margin">In God are vve made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to doe good: in our ſelues, vvee Ioſe all: euen our ovvne ſelues.</note> by the Lorde.

Nor yet, whether wée haue any light or not, any force and might or no, any wil, any mouing, any care any deſire: For it is eaſily knowen, without God we haue nothing.</p>
               <p>This is it which I touche briefely at this time, and it is my queſtion:
<note place="margin">The calling of the finner, and the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in this life of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly man, is the onely vvorke of God.</note> That in the conuerſion of the wicked and vngodly man vnto the Lorde: Whereby hée is throughly greeued for his ſinne: whereby hée ſéeth in a liuely faith, the frée mercie of God, and the benefite of his Mediatour: whereby hee is inſtified before the Lorde: whereby hee is renued: whereby he is lightened: whether or not, there be a minde and readineſſe in him: whether his will, his ſoule and his vnderſtanding is raiſed or ſtirred vp of him ſelfe, of his owne libertie, at his pleaſure, for to knowe, Séeke the Lorde, and his Chriſte? Or whether his whole conuerſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: his alteration: his regeneration, is to be referred to the Spirite of the Lorde, and the woorking of God? and his minde moued and ſettled by the Holy Ghoſt? or whether it commeth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>réede of him ſelfe? This therefore to bee ſhorte, it commeth and procéedeth all from God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:8428:79"/>
For firſt I ſhewe,
<note place="margin">With our conception commeth in ſin: vviped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvay in the blood of Chriſt.</note> that from the toppe of the heade to the ſoule of the foote, wee are full of botches and blaines, there is no whole parte within vs: as the leprocie the bodie: ſo doth Sathanas infecte the ſoule: as the botches and byles, the ſkinne and fleſhe: So the deuill, the minde and heart of man. For wee are vnder bondage, &amp; ſeruitude, and in the ſlauerie of this world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ſpirite of God onely doth drawe vs and doth renew vs, &amp; doth make vs newe creatures. The minde and heart of man is ruled and obayeth: of our ſelues wee can doe nothing,
<note place="margin">The manner and order of our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> no not thinke a good thought: this is more plainely ſeene by the forme of this prayer that I haue in hande. For the caller is the Lorde, it is done by his will to ſaue them that bée on earth, to fulfill the petition that it may be with vs as it is in heauen. The next cauſe hereof is Chriſte.
<note place="margin">If man had life of him ſelfe: then no man vvoulde die: but this is ſalſe: then no doubt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life commeth from God.</note> Firſt for that he became man. Nexte, to ſaue men, his bloud was ſhedde, and hee died to get vs life. Thirdly, he roſe from death, and went vp to heauen, that wee might haue our dwelling and manſion with him who is aboue.</p>
               <p>To haue an aſſuraunce hereof, we haue the ſpirite that continually worketh in the mindes of thoſe that be his, whome he hath ſeuered from the beginning of the world to dwel with him. That he hath prediſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated vnto life, and made the heires of his glorie.
<note place="margin">Sorites: or rather grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio.</note> For whome hee hath elected thoſe he calleth: whome hee calleth thoſe hee iuſtifieth: whome hee iuſtifieth, thoſe hee glorifieth. And where is nowe the will of man?</p>
               <p>But to vnderſtand more plainely the way and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his elect whome he hath appointed in this life, to dwell with him.</p>
               <p>Firſt I giue them this note, that it is by regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit, which they ſhall féele working in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:8428:80"/>that being ouerwhelmed in ſinne, and loden with ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, they ſhall haue taſt of their owne tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and a hatred of themſelus as touching the fleſh. And they doe riſe out of darkeneſſe and the luſtes of this life,
<note place="margin">So longe as there is life, ſo long raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſin, in our mortall bodies: yet by our impu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tation in Chriſt, it is vviped avvay.</note> and reforme them as newe creatures vnto God and his Chriſt, making ſhipwrecke of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies for the teſtimonie of his trueth. And therefore conuertion or repentaunce is in the regenerate man in whome there is an alteration and chaunge from this wicked and vngodly life. His ſoule it ſorroweth for the ſinne paſt. Contrition and repentaunce is ſo ſetled within him, that the feare of the iudgementes and wrath of GOD hangeth ouer him. But hee knoweth that he is ſaued and kept from it in Chriſte.</p>
               <p>For this cauſe we haue a lather to climbe w<hi rend="sup">e</hi>al into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; by ſteps &amp; degrées as it were to come to God.</p>
               <p>The firſt is our conuertion from ſinne,
<note place="margin">Foure ſeueral things requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man</note> vnto holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and good conuerſation.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is our quickning or our renewing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the image of God, that is in man. The third is our gouernement or direction in the whole courſe of our whole life. The fourth is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perfection of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, according to the gifte of perſeuerance &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing to thend of our race.
<note place="margin">This meane is much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempned: preachinge deſpiſed if the man bee misliked: therfore is there open to kens of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Truth it is that God hath left vs a meane in earth and a way to atteine to this, and it is by hearing his word, wherein the lawe and the goſpell is verie plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully ſet out vnto vs. And therfore the counſailes of Chriſt may be ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that vpon the excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie of his meſſage ſheweth our duetie. For hee witneſſeth that he ſpake not of him ſelf, but from the father, that ſent him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> had giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him a commaundement what to ſay, &amp; what to ſpeake. And ſainct <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, I make open vnto you the Goſpel which I preached,
<note place="margin">Enthuſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike, very he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes.</note> whiche you haue receiued, wherein you ſtande, and wherein you are ſaued. Therefore we looke not here vpon the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:8428:80"/>of <hi>Enthuſiaſtiſts,</hi> that be franticke, and thinke they haue the ſpirite. Nor of the Anabaptiſtes that looke for reuelations and dreames.
<note place="margin">Heare the vvorde, refuſe it not: rebell not againſt the ſpirite.</note> But wee take a meane giuen vnto vs by the ſpirit which is the word. For as man hath power to heare, to vnderſtande, to giue eare, &amp; to reade: ſo vnleſſe there come a ſchoule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſter to inſtruct vs, and a gouerner to guide vs wee doe as <hi>Agrippa</hi> did. We come but faire and ſoftely.</p>
               <p>I acknowledge an hethniſh and as it were an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landiſh kinde of reuerence that we giue vnto the lord, which is in a bare ſight of the heauens &amp; vewe of the Elementes, that iudgeth there is a Lorde. But this it maketh not vnto ſaluation. And for that cauſe the Prophets &amp; the Apoſtles calleth man but by the name of him that is in darkeneſſe and in death. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſainct <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, the light appeared in darkenes, and the darkeneſſe comprehendid it not. And Sainct <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, the worldly or fleſhly man perceiueth not thoſe things which are of the ſpirit, for they be fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes vnto him.
<note place="margin">God is ſaide to do it: the ſonne to bring it, the holy ghoſt to finiſh it, if it be good that is man: and this vvorke is but one.</note> And Chriſt himſelf affirmeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> no man knoweth the father, but the ſonne &amp; he vnto whom he reuealeth him. And againe when he aſked <hi>Peter,</hi> who ſaiſt thou that I am? He aunſwered, thou art Chriſt the ſonne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> liuing God. Happie art thou <hi>Symon</hi> ſaid the Lorde for fleſh and bloude hath not reuealed this, but my father which is in heauen. And therefore ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie louingly it is ſaid vnto vs that for this end, Chriſt came into the world euen vnto iudgement, that thoſe which are blinde might ſée. Then this is the ful force and aucthoritie of the ſpirite, that ruleth and altereth the actions in man, and maketh the doings of thoſe in the world to be acceptable, by quickening &amp; reuiuing,
<note place="margin">Proofe, that all our good actions come of God.</note> by altering &amp; by renewing the man of God which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was vnperfect.</p>
               <p>That it is the worke of the ſpirte, take that in the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:8428:81"/>Prophet, they ſhalbe all taught of God. Any that of Chriſt, when the comforter ſhall come, the ſpirite of truth, he ſhall teach you all things. For ſo I finde it euerie where: <hi>Lydia</hi> did heare, whoſe hart the Lorde opened that ſhe might giue eare vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words of <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">god electeth: Chriſte ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth: the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite vvorketh and all this, is but one vvork in one God.</note> And therefore one of the Prophets. I will giue them an heart they ſhal knowe me. So that the true vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, hearing, following and obſeruing the laws of the Lord, from whence come they? But from aboue from the Lorde of trueth, from him that willeth the ſaluation of all, euen of all thoſe that hee will ſaue. For where Sainct <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that the fulneſſe of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſhall come in. And againe it is ſaide in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets all fleſh ſhall ſée the ſaluation of our God.</p>
               <p>I vnderſtand it thus: Euen as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that place in <hi>Math.</hi> That God willeth all men ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be ſaued, of thoſe ſaith he whome he hath determined for to ſaue. For as <hi>Gregorie Nazianzen</hi> confuteth the heretickes that denied the holy ghoſt to be God, out of the firſt of Iohn that reaſoned with him in the ſame text. Euen ſo do I here. For vpon that place in <hi>Iohn</hi> by him were all thinges made and without him were nothing made that was made, they cauell thus.</p>

                  <item>The holy ghoſt is ſome thing and exiſteth.</item>
                  <item>Ergo, the holy ghoſt is a creature and made by him.</item>
               </list>
               <p>That father <hi>Nazianzen</hi> aunſwereth thus.

It is our parte to beginne that is good, but the part of God to end it: our part to offer that we can, his part to finiſh that we wil: But howe can we moſt

And therefore, for that hee ruleth all, let vs commit our ſelues into his hand that guydeth vs: and not curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſerch, that hath in his ſecret determination ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the wayes &amp; the ſteppes, and the hearts &amp; mindes of all fleſhe.

The next and the moſte perfect will of God is reuealed by the Goſpell, without which knowledge we are in death. This he hath moſte fully opened in Ieſus Chriſt his ſonne, the redeemer onely &amp; ſauiour of the worlde, whome hee hath appointed the onely, true, &amp; right inſtructour of thoſe that dwell in earth: according to the Oracle receiued from heauen.

Not that Chriſt was not knowen before: for he is openly deſiphered out in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophete. But in eſpeciall at his incarnation: when hee tooke our fleſh vpon him, &amp; was made man: it was fulfilled that euery one ſhall tell his neighbour, &amp; from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to the leaſt: euen babes &amp; little ones ſhoulde pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of the workes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord &amp; tel abrode his name.

And this is the will of God ſpoken of in this prayer, that we ſéeke not after any other knowledge: but onely

               <p>Nowe to know this will of God the better,

<note place="margin">The Church of God is knovven, in that they Ioue one another.</note> And it is firſt required that as their is one God, ſo we agrée and loue as one. That wee loue him withall our heart: with our ſoule, with our might: it is his will, that thoſe purified, waſhed, and clenſed in his bloude: doe not defile their bodies that be temples of the holy ghoſt: but kéepe them as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled members of his Church.

               <p>Then in theſe thrée, the loue of God, the holineſſe of life, the mutuall ſocietie &amp; brotherly loue one with another, is the will of God repoſed. This it is that

               <p>Thirdly it is the will of the Lorde, that we be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and made like in the image of his ſon Chriſte: And as by his croſſe and death he entered the glorious heauens,

Yet euery one in his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and eche perſon in comlineſſe, hath his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenannce, and his beautie from the Lorde.</p>
               <p>I ſometimes talked with one not ſo well inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as I wiſhed in this.

               <p>I am compelled here, as otherwiſe I confeſſe in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, to vſe oftentimes interpretation &amp; notes of the Scholemen: neyther am I aſhamed to profeſſe that openly, the vſe whereof I finde to be ſo great by priuate conference. For euen vnto the worſt of them all wee owe muche. And God hath looked vppon vs in theſe dayes that hath lefte vnto his churche as many volumes of ſuche as be pure and perfect ſtile: that ſpeake their verie mother foung in Latine, and iudge diſcréetely of the Gréeke, as euer they had.

<note place="margin">Our bread is aſked: for that it is not common vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one but to vs all: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God vvould haue vs remember our brethren as vvel as our ovvne ſelues, &amp; the vvhole church as our priuate fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</note> I haue here and there paynted out this treatiſe with ſuch flowers, as not altogether robbing them, I coulde or might conueniently gather in my writings. Whereof this is one: He ſaieth Ours: not as hauing right or title of our ſelues to claim him as our owne, or ought elſe. But for that of his grace he géeueth it vs and that fréely. It is ſaide to bee ours. For ſo is Chriſte called our Lorde, and our redéemer, not as brought in by vs. But ours, in that wée haue néede of him, and in our life call on him. For that God the father elected and predeſtinated from all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, that he ſhould be our wiſedome, our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, our ſanctification. Therefore <hi>Cyprian, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter noſter quia intelligentium &amp; credentium pater eſt. Et panem noſtrum vocamus.

               <p>In that hee ſaith our breade, wee are admoniſhed euery one of his priuate calling.

Not buylding by the houſes of our forefathers in bloud? nor garniſhing our Iuery beddes with other mennes labours: but euery one quietly to enioy his owne.

Our dayly bread: or as the Gréeke: this day our breade:
<note place="margin">Such is the condition of man, that the ſame thing vvhich hee hath this day the verie ſame hee miſſeth on the morrovv</note> Signifieth our pouertie, or the neceſſitie &amp; penurie wherein wée bee: that hauing nothing of our ſelues, are faine to craue all thinges of another.

The bodie diſgeſteth that it receiued before: So that it hungreth and panteth for more. And therefore wée ſaye: This day, or from day to day. Or as in <hi>Mathew</hi> This daye.</p>
               <p>The meaning whereof I take this: that God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his benefits &amp; the vſe of his creatures to all: not nowe, but continually at all ſeaſons: It is our prayer hée would vouchſafe to remember vs at this preſente, as hée hath of his goodnes beſtowed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs heretofore.

               <p>This meditation of ſo diſcrete a Father as he was: I would it were imprinted more déepely then it is in themyndes of men. That hawtines and ſtately

               <p>The ſeconde hinde of men that I note here, I would I might but looke vppon them, Come neare them I dare not, they bee ſo glorious: Their Marble

That ſo muche the more maketh me to wonder, as I ſée their ende to approch and their glorie to be tranſitorie. For when he hath ſailed in many a perilous ſtorme, and put his life into the handes of Pyrates, and is nowe become gray headed and withered vp by long labour. Yet the value of his ſubſtance is not verie many thouſandes.
<note place="margin">All that the dayes of man is labour and tediouſnes: &amp; in the ende, his ſubſtance is not great, &amp; he carrieth nothing vvith him to the graue.</note> And then committeth be his goods paraduenture to the fire.

This is a ſtraunge thing and yet it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among you of the Citie. For either the ſea and the waues thereof conſumeth them, or the eaſdrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and the lurkers in corners ſcatter them: or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretely the Lord himſelfe by one or other meanes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth them. For as lightning paſſeth &amp; vaniſheth out of ſight: ſo withereth away the riches of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man. And as the ſnowe melteth at the fire, or as the froſt at the heate of the ſun: ſo doth the ſubſtance of the vngodly, at the becke of the Lorde. The wages of the euill are crooked, and they are lewde in their pathes. Glorie remaineth with him in his youth, and beggerie dwelleth with him in his age. For the ſoule of the poore man panteth for ſorowe, and he ruffeleth in the ſtreetes, and paſſeth by the miſerable: he ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth his eare, and regardeth not the crie.
<note n="*" place="margin">The portion of the ſinner is death, his vvayes is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, his glorie is ſhame, his children bee beggers, and his name is buryed in diſhonour.</note> Wherfore the wicked ſhalbe cut off from the earth, and the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours ſhalbe rooted out of it. For the way to his houſe is death, &amp; the path of the ſinner carieth to the graue, and hell fyre conſumeth him quicke: becauſe he truſteth in his riches &amp; maketh the world his God, and ſaith to his ſubſtance we ſhall dwell for euer, hee neuer remembreth to pray vnto the Lord: <hi>Giue vs this

<note place="margin">The euill racking of the purpoſe and drifte of God, is the cauſe of our blindneſſe &amp; ignorance: for fleſhe and bloud is not able to attain the depth of his vviſedom</note> the God of hoaſtes, he worketh by an other way, and his iudgement is aboue the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie of man: For God wrought not naughtines in <hi>Adames</hi> heart firſt: But ordeined that ſathan moued by his owne cankered and corrupt nature, ſhoulde worke in him, and corrupt <hi>Adam</hi> by his owne falte. For in that the ſinne and infirmitie whiche lurketh in an other, is bewrayed and brought to light, marke the prouidence and gouernement of the Lorde: which bringeth that to paſſe whereby his owne wiſedome, righteouſneſſe and mercy may appeare.

Take the reaſon. God hath a Conſideration in his will and purpoſe more then man hath: for an vnthriftie childe willeth the death of his father. God alſo will haue him die. But it is in another maner. The vnthriftie ſonne doth it, to enioy his fathers goodes: God doth it to make an exchaunge to conueigh him out of miſerie to life, if he bee his: for hee ordeined it before all beginninge. Or to tranſlate him from vs vnto death, if hee hath not choſen him in Chriſte, for it is his lot, and hee decréede it before the worlde. And heere I ſtaye.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the ſway in the Church, this I ſay briefly.</p>
            <p>I can not finde any difference in the primatius Churche from ours, but in the name alone: for they bad Biſhoppes, and they alſo whome they called Elders: and wee haue Miniſters, whiche they called Docters: wee haue Inſtructours, whiche they called Teachers: we haue Rulers, whom they called Seniors: we haue Preſbiters, that were Paſtours: we haue other Dignities, which they called Offices:
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:8428:120"/>ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> we haue, as they had: onely they ſuffer vs not to be as they were. For that argument of <hi>Archaepoume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos:</hi> It is not ſo pithy nor ſo ſtrongly wreſted, as once I thought: neither yet that, of one head of one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: for many Kings, yet one King, as haue béen: &amp; many Biſhops, yet one Biſhop: as is: Not many Kings as many heades to deuide one bodie: but one heade to kéepe the kingdome of that ſame bodie. Not many Biſhops as ſubuerting them: But one Biſhop ouer Biſhops to protect them: Not diuers heades of one bodie to deuide them: but one heade of diuers members to vpholde them: ſo then, our Biſhops, and their Biſhops, and in Ieſus Chriſte, one Biſhop: let vs nowe approach vnto his calling.</p>
            <p>Two kind of wayes are wee called.</p>
            <p>By the Lord, &amp; by men: ordinarely &amp; mediately: &amp; ſtrangely, by the Lord God &amp; inwardly: As <hi>Moſes,</hi> by the hand of the Lord, by the flaming buſh: <hi>Leuy</hi> &amp; his Famely by the forecounſell of God: <hi>Aaron</hi> ſeuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the congregation: <hi>Elyas,</hi> from among the reſidue of the Prophets: <hi>Samuel,</hi> from among the children of <hi>Ely: Gad,</hi> &amp; <hi>Nathan,</hi> from the children of their Tribes with others.</p>
            <p>A mong the nations alſo called he very ſtraungely a great number: <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> from <hi>Meſopotamia: Balaam</hi> from out of the mountaines, and from the Eaſt. <hi>Iob,</hi> in the lande of <hi>Hus. Scibillae</hi> mutch ſpoken of among writers: <hi>Ioſeph in Aegypt, Ionas</hi> in <hi>Niniui: Daniel</hi> in <hi>Babilon: Nehemias</hi> and <hi>Eſdras,</hi> among the <hi>Pertians,</hi> all which were ſtraung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſome of them extraordinarelie called by the Lord: and this kinde of calling ceaſeth: and we take an other into our Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:8428:121"/>
The ſecond order of calling Miniſters: it is ordinarie.</p>
            <p n="1">1 It is therefore put to the ſecreat workinge of the Spirite of the Lorde, in the mindes of men.</p>
            <p n="2">2 And to that which <hi>Paull</hi> ſaith here: he that deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a Biſhoppricke, deſireth a good worke.</p>
            <p n="3">3 And to the wiſedome and diſcretion of him that chooſeth them.</p>
            <p>As when that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> twelue called the brethren toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; charged them to chooſe out ſeuen men of honeſt report: Act. <hi>6.</hi> Like as <hi>Paul</hi> when he came to <hi>Derbe,</hi> and had herde of <hi>Timotheus,</hi> that had a good report of the brethren, that were at <hi>Liſtra</hi> and <hi>Iconium Act. 16.</hi> That it may be vereſted of vs, ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Lord by <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Barnabas:</hi> that he had put them a part, &amp; choſen them vnto a good worke. Act. <hi>13.</hi> where I finde no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular conſent, nor any acclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people, as in <hi>Rome</hi> when they chooſed Cenſors, Dictators, Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, Pretors, and ſuch like: neither caſt they as it were lotts, or els gaue it vnto election of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude: or els tyed to the congregation a lone: but the likaunce was giuen to one <hi>Elder:</hi> the choyſe to him that was wiſe in the Church: and hee that was choſen, continued as their Ruler, for euer.</p>
            <p>That al things may be fully don: their is adioyned the putting on of hands. I take it that this cuſtome came from the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> who as any thing was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; conſecrated to the Lorde: ſo they vſed to lay their hands thereon: ſignifying that, that thing they gaue, they willingly gaue it vnto the Lord. So <hi>Iacob.</hi> bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> laide his handes vppon their beads: ſo did Chriſt lay his handes on the little babes, that were brought vnto him. In the ſame ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, layed they handes on their ſacrifices.</p>
            <p>Therefore when they made choiſe of Docters, Paſtors, Teachers, Deacons, they layed handes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:8428:121"/>them: to ſhew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This is a pitifull crye, &amp; it is aſcended vp alreadie vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eares of the Lord: the people they are readie to ſtarue: they houle in their miſerie: and crie out in the verie paine and ſmart of their ſoules, vppon vs the miniſters of the Lorde, that harden other mens harts by our coueteouſneſſe. <hi>Naball</hi> muſt néedes be harde and gréedie: and no meruaile, if <hi>Diues</hi> thinke much to giue vnto <hi>Lazarus:</hi> that ritche men ſéeke for newe barnes to put in their ſtoore, when they of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and ſuch as be in the houſe of God, continually thirſte to inritch them. Well, the Church of God periſheth in her miſerie, and panteth ſo ſore, that ſhe is burſt with crying, becauſe that this is not looked vnto. In a cleere teſtimonie of my conſcience, I vtter the trueth vnto you, for I haue ſeene it in ſome, I knowe it in many, it is common in all. Hoſpitalitie here ſo much accompted of, of <hi>Paul,</hi> is termed huſbandrie: For if you ſaue much greedely, that your childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may ſpend it laſciuiouſly: it is ſaide to be but good huſbandrie. I once was at <hi>Pauls Croſſe,</hi> when as a learned &amp; graue father preaching there, among many other thinges ſpake much then of this vice: He called to memorie at that time, for the ſpace of many yeares before, that there had been no one Alderman in al London, whoſe ſenne was remembred to haue vſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honeſtly which
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:8428:127" rendition="simple:additions"/>the father in many yeares, had ſeraped vp ſo coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly: It was a ſore and heauie ſaying for thoſe wiſe and gray headed men that were then preſent: And the ſaying of that wiſe Prophet moued the hartes of many that heard it.</p>
            <p>There is at this daye, nowe in London, in moſte floriſhinge ſtate, two ſonnes of two Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, gouerninge by the wealth their fathers lefte them, the happie and good ſtate of that Citie. But if that olde and grayheaded father were now aliue, and ſpeaking of the miniſters of the worde of God, ſhoulde turne his eyes to ſée the iolitie, wherin their children be: that ſame diſcréete father, for the two famous &amp; moſt worthy Shrifes, that haue gouerned that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Cytie of London, could not (ſince that Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande was inhabited and knowen of men) picke out ſo much as two ſonnes, of two Biſhoppes, to haue ſat in the ſeate of their fathers: I ſpeake it as in ſuch a time, wherein the Lorde hath ſent a rot among vs: that wiſe men and moſt good and godly men ſhoulde haue ſo lewde and wicked children. This is it I ſay, The Lord wil haue their ſonnes to ſpende it wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for that their fathers haue rackte it vp ſo vnkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: And if that money were beſtowed on the poore, which pine away for want of foode, or ſome other way to the good and profite of the Church, which lyeth ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in their coffers, and motheaten with ruſt: the Lorde would not onely proſper them, as good <hi>Phinees,</hi> to haue the honour of the Prieſthoode to remaine in their houſes for euer: But they ſhoulde be ſuer to haue one in the fauour and ſight of God, in a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall generation.</p>
            <p>The worlde is nowe ſo proude, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple therein ſo ſtately, that if the ſonne of a miniſter be not a gentleman, the ſonne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſter ſhal bee but in accompt a begger. There is ſome in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:8428:127"/>that haue good and large ſtipends for ſeruing the Lorde, and they ſpende it as liberally on their Sonnes to make them Courtiers: Well, <hi>Aaron</hi> did not ſo, either <hi>Eleazar</hi> ſo, eyther els the Apoſtles and bretheren of the Lorde, eyther els did <hi>Cephas</hi> or the reſidew ſo: Pittye it is, the Churche of God, to ſée how it ſerueth: how the people die for foode: the hedge of the Lorde, how it is broken downe: and they of the houſe do not ſo much as ſend their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of their houſe to repayre it. The Lorde moue his Prophetes, to ſee vnto it: And giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> earneſt of his ſpirit, the zeale of his glorye, the feare of his name, the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of his Maieſtye, they ought to haue: that his Goſpell may bée farthered, his <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> builded, his Citye finiſhed, his Church fetled, that (if it bee his will) it may fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> henceforth, bee neuer more remoued: we haue now run thorow, the two firſt peeces, of our laſt worke, euen a litle liberty more, and I doubt not but I ſhall diſpatch the reſt.

But I would all the Lords in <hi>Iſrael</hi> heard mée, that there might not ſo much as a Porter be lefte in the houſe of God, if hée were not able to open &amp; locke the doores, by good title: This is the poore councell that I am able to giue you at this time, O you of the kindred of <hi>Leuy:</hi> that euery man make cleane his veſſelles, and kéepe holy his owne ſoule, that hee may bée blameleſſe at the day of the Lorde.

               </gap>, Arte thou a Miniſter? It is expedient thou bée a teacher: For I ſay from <hi>Ezechiell</hi> and from the Lorde. If God ſende a ſworde into the land, and that people haue a Watchman, that is ſet ouer them: That ſame man when hée ſéeth the ſworde, ſhall blowe the Trompet and warne the people: If a man heare, and is not warned, but the ſworde come and take him away, his blood ſhalbe on his owne head: for hée heard the ſound of the Trompet, and cared not. If the watchman ſée the ſworde comminge and telleth it not, if any of the people bée hurt, hée ſhall die in his ſinne, his blood wil I require at the watchmans hand: Agayne, if I ſay vnto the wicked, thou wicked thou ſhalte ſurely dye, and hée may beware, and will not, hée dyeth in his ſinnes, his blood will I aſke at his owne handes.</p>
            <p>But if hée bée wicked, and thou telleſt not the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of his wickednes, hée ſhal ſurely dye in his ſinne, but his blood will I require at thy hands: for as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye as the Lorde liueth, if hee ſtretch forth his hande ouer a Citye and deſtroy prouiſion of bread, and ſend dearth amonge them to diſtroy man and beaſt in the féelde, though <hi>Noe, Daniell</hi> and <hi>Iob,</hi> thoſe thrée men were among them: yet ſhall they ſaue but their own ſoules. If I bring noyſome beaſtes into the lande to waſte it vp, and leaue it deſolate, that no man may go therein, for Scorpions and wilde beaſtes. If theſe three men were there, they ſhoulde ſaue but their owne ſoules. And if he ſende out a Peſtilence into the lande, and poore out his ſore indignation on it in blood, ſo that hee rooteth out both man and beaſte, If <hi>Noe, Daniell,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iob,</hi> were therin, they ſhould deliuer neyther ſonnes, neyther doughters, but ſaue their owne ſoules, in their owne righteouſnes: well, I
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:8428:129"/>exhorte you all in the Lorde, and in the name of the Church of God, which waltering in many corners of England, holdeth vp her handes vnto you, that being wearied with long and great tediouſneſſe, is not able to lifte vp her heade any longer. That now ſhiuering thorows all the ioyntes of her bodie, cryeth out piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, for inſtruction at your handes. That béeing defaced heretofore with baſe and homely doctrine, craueth to be fed with good Diſcipline, and receiue good and ſtrong meate from you: and I craue it in the name of Ieſus Chriſt which hath bought you, and for his bloudſhedding which hath ranſomed you, and for the mediation on his behalfe, which dayly proſpereth you: That you woulde be good and faithfull ſtewards in the houſe of God: That henceforth you ſuffer no diſſolute and gyddiheads to trouble her, no dombe and doltiſh miniſters to muſſle her, no Prieſtes of <hi>Baall,</hi> no bringers of newfangles, to come néere her: You ſhall increaſe to the Lorde GOD the number of his choſen people, you ſhall ſtrengthen the weake, helpe the féeble, incurrage the poore in ſpirite, make ſtrong the féeble knées, open the eyes of the blinde, helpe the ignoraunt, and builde vp the walles of his ſpirituall <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> I haue deſcribed heatherto, the halfe face of ſuch a Prophet, as I haue ſeldome heard of in any commmon welth: pleaſe it you to giue me leaue, to touch but the very hem of this his next garment: If then I giue him not ſufficient clothing, I am content to let him go for this time: hereafter when I am wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier, more fully to attyre him.</p>

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:8428:130"/>to looke out on, where he muſt be watching: For that he is in a verie brickle place, I haue ſet one to waite vpon him, to kéepe him in ſobrietie: hee is couered with diſcréetion: and being a man of wiſedome he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth not him ſelfe ſo much as others, he beſtoweth therefore on his neighbours, and kéepeth hoſpitalitie: And knowing that men liue not by breade onely, hée diggeth for the pittes of the water of life, and teacheth them to ſéeke the <hi>Manhu</hi> came downe from heauen: Laſtly, as one able to diſcharge ſo great an office, hee hath Abſtinency as kéeper of him ſelfe, and others, that they abſteine from ſuch thinges as be hurtefull, and ſéeke them, maye profite all. In the booke of God, there is preſcript commaundement giuen, as touching them, that abſtayned: <hi>Loquere ad filios Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, vir, ſiue mulier, ſi vouerint votum Nadir ſepare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſe a domino, a vino &amp; ſiſera abſtineant: &amp;c.</hi> Of abſtainers I finde two ſortes.

This was that whereon the Papiſtes tooke ſo much holde, for their

Yet either as <hi>Phormio</hi> to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> or as one emboldened to ſpeake at this preſent, I preſume in the name of the Lord God, in the behalfe of his Church, and of the flocke he hath committed to vs, to ſpeake thus much.

And nowe euen laſt of all, hauinge ſayd what I doo thinke, and vttered that I meane, in a true teſtimony of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: I craue pardon at your handes, my fellowe Bretheren and laborers in the Lord: Take this my farewell and laſt ſpéeche among you.
